# Overview

This guide outlines how to install `SoupX` and `DropletUtils` on the cluster using source `.tar.gz` files and your personal R library directory.

---

# 1. Set your personal R library

In any R session (locally or on the cluster), set your personal library path:

```r
.libPaths("~/library")
```

This ensures R installs packages into your user-specific directory rather than the system-wide library.

---

# 2. Download source packages to your local machine

From your **Mac terminal**:

```bash
# Download SoupX from CRAN (archived version as example)
curl -L -o SoupX_1.6.2.tar.gz https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/SoupX/SoupX_1.6.2.tar.gz

# Download DropletUtils from Bioconductor
curl -L -o DropletUtils_1.26.0.tar.gz https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/DropletUtils_1.26.0.tar.gz
```

> You can replace the version numbers with the latest versions if needed.

---

# 3. Upload the `.tar.gz` files to the cluster

From your **local terminal**, upload both files to the cluster:

```bash
# Replace <username> and <cluster-address> with your own credentials
scp SoupX_1.6.2.tar.gz <username>@<cluster-address>:~
scp DropletUtils_1.26.0.tar.gz <username>@<cluster-address>:~
```

---

# 4. Load R on the UHN cluster

Once logged in to the cluster:

```bash
module load R
R
```

Then inside the R console:

```r
.libPaths("~/library")  # Set your personal library path
```

---

# 5. Install required dependencies

In the R session on the cluster:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install(c("rhdf5", "Rhdf5lib", "HDF5Array"), ask = FALSE)

q()  # Quit R after installing
```

---

# 6. Install SoupX and DropletUtils from source

Back in the shell (not inside R):

```bash
R CMD INSTALL ~/SoupX_1.6.2.tar.gz --library=~/library
R CMD INSTALL ~/DropletUtils_1.26.0.tar.gz --library=~/library
```

---

# 7. Confirm installation

Open a new R session:

```bash
module load R
R
```

Then check if the packages load:

```r
.libPaths("~/library")
library(SoupX)
library(DropletUtils)
```

---

# Done!

You're now ready to use `SoupX` and `DropletUtils` in your single-cell RNA-seq pipeline on the cluster.



Optional:
# Installing SoupX and DropletUtils via Conda on macOS"
This guide provides instructions for installing `SoupX` and `DropletUtils` using Conda on macOS. This method is helpful when installing packages with system-level dependencies (e.g., HDF5, zlib) or when avoiding conflicts with system R.

---

# 1. Install Miniconda (if not already installed)

Check if Conda is installed:

```bash
conda --version
```

If not, download and install Miniconda for macOS:  
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

> Tip: You can also use [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) for faster dependency resolution.

---

# 2. Create a new Conda environment with R

```bash
conda create -n scRNAseq_env r-base=4.2 r-essentials
conda activate scRNAseq_env
```

You can replace `4.2` with your required R version.

---

# 3. Install SoupX and DropletUtils

```bash
# DropletUtils from Bioconductor
conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-dropletutils

# SoupX (if available)
conda install -c conda-forge r-soupx
```

> If `r-soupx` is not available via Conda, install it manually from CRAN:
```bash
Rscript -e 'install.packages("SoupX", repos="https://cran.r-project.org")'
```

---

# 4. Launch R and verify installation

```bash
R
```

Then in R:

```r
library(SoupX)
library(DropletUtils)
```

If both libraries load without error, the installation is successful.

---

# Done!

You now have a self-contained Conda environment with `SoupX` and `DropletUtils`.

---

# Optional: Use Jupyter or RStudio inside the same environment

To install RStudio or R notebook support:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge r-irkernel rstudio
```

You can now run R in JupyterLab or launch RStudio from the same Conda environment.
