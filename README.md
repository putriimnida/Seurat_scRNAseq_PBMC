# Seurat v5: scRNA-seq Analysis of PBMCs (2,700 cells)

This repository documents my learning journey and practice using the Seurat v5 package for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data analysis. The dataset analyzed consists of 2,700 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) made publicly available by 10X Genomics, following the official Seurat v5 tutorial.
